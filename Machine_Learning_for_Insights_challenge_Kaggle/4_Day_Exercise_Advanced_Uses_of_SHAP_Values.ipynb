In real-world terms, this diagnosis is rare, but poses a larger risk for people who have it. In contrast, payer_code_? has many values of both blue and pink, and both have SHAP values that differ meaningfully from 0.

Said another way, both high and low values of the feature can have both positive and negative effects on the prediction. The most likely explanation for this \"jumbling\" of effects is that the variable (in this case num_lab_procedures) has an interaction effect with other variables. For example, there may be some diagnoses for which it is good to have many lab procedures, and other diagnoses where suggests increased risk. We don't yet know what other feature is interacting with num_lab_procedures though we could investigate that with SHAP contribution dependence plots."
